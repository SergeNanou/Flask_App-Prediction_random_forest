# Flask_App-Prediction_random_forest
The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project is designed for disaggregated conflict analysis and crisis mapping. This dataset codes the dates and locations of all reported political violence and protest events in dozens of developing countries in Africa. Political violence and protest includes events that occur within civil wars and periods of instability, public protest and regime breakdown. The project covers all African countries from 1997 to the present.

In this project we create a model with flask and machine learning(Random forest)
